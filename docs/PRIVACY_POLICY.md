# Privacy Policy for MelodyX

**Effective Date: January 20, 2026**

Christopher (the "Developer") built the MelodyX app as a free app. This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page informs users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use our Service.

## Information Collection and Use

MelodyX collects certain data to provide features, improve the app, and display advertisements. This includes:
- Device information (e.g., model, OS version, unique device identifiers like Android Advertising ID).
- App usage data (e.g., session duration, interactions, crashes) for analytics and performance monitoring.
- Data related to advertisements (e.g., ad impressions, clicks) to measure effectiveness and personalize ads.

We use Google AdMob for advertising, which collects and processes this data. AdMob may use your advertising ID and other information to serve personalized ads based on your interests and app activity. You can opt out of personalized ads via your device settings (Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization). For more details, see Google's Advertising Policies: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

Data is collected automatically when you use the app and is encrypted in transit using secure protocols (HTTPS). We do not collect sensitive personal information such as names, emails, locations, or contacts unless you provide it voluntarily (e.g., via support inquiries). The app does not require user accounts or internet access beyond ad loading.

We do not share your data with third parties except as required for ad services (e.g., with Google) or legal compliance. Data is not sold to advertisers.

## Log Data

In case of an error, we may collect log data (via third-party tools like Firebase Crashlytics) including device info and app state to diagnose issues.

## Cookies and Tracking

The app does not use cookies directly, but ad networks may use similar technologies for tracking across apps and sites.

## Third-Party Services

The app uses:
- Google Play Services for distribution, updates, and core functionality (governed by https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- Google AdMob for ads (governed by https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)

These services may collect data independently—review their policies for details.

## Children's Privacy

MelodyX does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app is not targeted at children, but if we discover such data has been collected, we will delete it immediately. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## Data Security

We prioritize data security, but no transmission over the internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute protection.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for changes. We will notify you of material changes by posting the new policy here or via app updates.

# Melodyx AI Curricula System

## Overview

The AI Curricula system provides personalized music education through adaptive learning algorithms. It analyzes player performance to create customized lesson plans that optimize skill development.

## Learning Modules

### 1. Ear Training Fundamentals

**Objective**: Develop basic pitch recognition and musical awareness.

#### Lessons
- Single note identification
- Octave recognition
- Basic interval detection (2nds, 3rds)
- Simple melody patterns

#### Progression
- Beginner: 3-note sequences
- Intermediate: 5-note sequences
- Advanced: 7+ note sequences

### 2. Interval Mastery

**Objective**: Recognize musical intervals by ear.

#### Intervals Covered
- Minor 2nd / Major 2nd
- Minor 3rd / Major 3rd
- Perfect 4th / Tritone
- Perfect 5th
- Minor 6th / Major 6th
- Minor 7th / Major 7th
- Octave

#### Training Methods
- Ascending vs descending
- Harmonic vs melodic
- Context-based recognition

### 3. Scale & Mode Recognition

**Objective**: Identify different scales and modes.

#### Content
- Major scale
- Natural minor scale
- Harmonic minor
- Melodic minor
- Pentatonic scales
- Blues scale
- Modal variations (Dorian, Mixolydian, etc.)

### 4. Rhythm & Timing

**Objective**: Develop rhythmic awareness and timing precision.

#### Skills
- Beat subdivision
- Syncopation recognition
- Time signature identification
- Tempo estimation

### 5. Chord Progressions

**Objective**: Recognize common harmonic patterns.

#### Progressions
- I-IV-V-I (Basic)
- I-V-vi-IV (Pop)
- ii-V-I (Jazz)
- I-vi-IV-V (50s)
- vi-IV-I-V (Modern)

## AI Adaptation Algorithm

### Performance Tracking

```
Metrics Collected:
- Accuracy rate per lesson type
- Response time
- Error patterns
- Session duration
- Streak consistency
```

### Difficulty Adjustment

The AI adjusts difficulty based on:

1. **Rolling Accuracy**: Last 20 attempts weighted average
2. **Confidence Score**: Based on response time consistency
3. **Error Pattern Analysis**: Identifies specific weaknesses
4. **Fatigue Detection**: Monitors performance degradation

### Lesson Recommendation Engine

```
Priority Calculation:
1. Weakness areas (highest priority)
2. Due for review (spaced repetition)
3. New content introduction
4. Reinforcement exercises
```

## Spaced Repetition System

### Intervals
- Initial review: 1 day
- First successful: 3 days
- Second successful: 7 days
- Third successful: 14 days
- Mastered: 30 days

### Forgetting Curve Compensation
- Failed reviews reset interval
- Difficulty-weighted intervals
- Context-aware scheduling

## Progress Tracking

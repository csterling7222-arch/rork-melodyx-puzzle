At Christopher (the Developer of MelodyX), we respect your privacy and provide a way to request deletion of your data associated with the app. MelodyX does not require user accounts, but collects limited data for advertising and analytics purposes (e.g., Android Advertising ID, device info, app usage stats via Google AdMob and related services).

## Steps to Request Data Deletion

1. **Gather your Android Advertising ID:** Go to your device Settings > Google > Ads > Your advertising ID.
2. **Email us** at melodyxceo@gmail.com with the subject "MelodyX Data Deletion Request". Include:
   - Your Advertising ID.
   - Device model and OS version (optional, for verification).
   - Any other details to help identify your data.
3. We will confirm receipt within 7 days and process the deletion within 30 days.

## Data Deleted

All collected data tied to your device/advertising ID, including:
- Usage analytics
- Ad interaction logs
- Any identifiers stored by third-party services like Google AdMob

## Data Kept

Aggregated, anonymized data not linked to you (e.g., for app improvement). No additional retention period beyond processing—data is permanently deleted.
